        Rynum is a magical planet outside of the solar system we have known all our lives. In fact, it is part of its
        very own solar system in the very center of a nebula (which acts as a barrier to keep in all magic particles).
        While unknown to Earthians, the people of Rynum have studied their own solar system. Rynum is the second planet
        from the sun and not the only one that is inhabitable. Rynum's sister planet has nearly the same atmosphere as
        Rynum, but it has yet to be colonized due to there being an over-abundance of carnivorous plants. The other
        planet that holds life is Eebor, the gas giant similar to our own Jupiter. A small colony has sprung up there
        underneath all the gases where there is a breathable atmosphere (granted, there are a few side effects from all
        the other gases).
      </p>
      <p>
        Rynum itself contains unique characteristics. No where else can there be found elves and dwarves, dragons and
        mages, fairies and humans all coexisting as in many famous Earthian stories. Portals are another facet unique to
        Rynum. Though originally the portals did not exist, they dot the land (even some parts of the sea) and connect
        Rynum to Earth.
