      Sierra was born in Arizona but has lived most of her life in southern Nevada. She graduated from high school early and earned an Associates of Arts degree in Creative Writing from the College of Southern Nevada. After serving a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints to southeastern Idaho, she fell in love with the area. She returned to Rexburg to continue her schooling. She is currently working to complete a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies with an emphasis in Creative Writing and Computer Information Technology. In her spare time, Sierra enjoys playing computer games, reading, and spending time with her family.
