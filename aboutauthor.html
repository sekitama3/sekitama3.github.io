    <h3>A Word from the Author</h3>
    <p>
      Ever since I was a little girl, I was fascinated with the creation of stories. Everything to me was an epic adventure that I was a part of. Once I learned how to read for entertainment, my whole world opened up in a way I never thought possible. New adventures became available to me. I already had an active imagination as a child and would always tell stories to my family. Once I figured out that normal people like me wrote books, I knew that one day I would share my own written stories with the world. From that moment on, I wanted to be an author. The earliest story I remember trying to write down was about two girls who ran away into a magical forest. Though I never completed that story, it formed the base for what is now the Reaching Yana series.
