      <h2><u>Your Home Away From Home</u></h2>
      <p>Temple Inn & Suites is proud to serve members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as they travel across the world to visit the numerous temples. Though this company is still in the beginning stages, we hope to establish a branch near every temple. Our goal is to provide a place where individuals and families alike can not only feel the spirit, but also be able to enjoy their time away from home. As such, we provide many of the luxuries of the home while keeping in touch with the central focus of the temple: connecting families together throughout all time.</p>

      <h2><u>Wedding Receptions</u></h2>
      <p>Weddings are a special time for families to spend time together. At Temple Inn & Suites, we understand the value of having a central place to gather together during this joyous time. Multiple rooms can be booked in blocks so family members are closer together. There is a large reception hall that can be utilized not only for the wedding reception, but also for family gatherings. Adjacent to the reception hall is a small kitchen for food preparation and serving.</p>
