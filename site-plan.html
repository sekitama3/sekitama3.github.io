    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>As people travel across the world, we are here to help accommodate those who desire to visit temples. We provide individuals with a place to reserve rooms where they can prepare for temple worship.</p>
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our primary audience is members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who hold temple recommends. These individuals may be visiting from far away, organizing a youth activity, or they may work in the temple. We also accommodate those who wish to visit the temples during the open house.</p>

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <h4>Heading Font: IM Fell English, Italics</h4>
    <p>This font was chosen for the headings due to it being readable yet still be elegant. Though there are other fonts that have more elegance, we want those who visit our website to be able to easily navigate and not have to interpret the many swooshes and curves found in other fonts.</p>
    <h4>Paragraph Font: Open Sans</h4>
    <p>The Open Sans font was chosen for paragraphs because it is a standard text. We want visitors to easily be able to read the information we provide. Additionally, by using a sans serif font, it slows the reader down while reading and improves comprehension of the text.</p>
    <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
    <p>We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to temple service and accomodations. Our shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe alternative for your family.</p>
    <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
    <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and freshing up in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>
