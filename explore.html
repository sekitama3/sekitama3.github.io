        Rynum is a magical planet outside of the solar system we have known all our lives. In fact, it is part of its very own solar system in the very center of a nebula (which acts as a barrier to keep in all magic particles). Rynum is the second planet from the sun and has a similar atmosphere to Earth. Though Rynum and Earth share similarities, they are also vastly different. The magical beings that roam all over Rynum are hardly found on Earth and humans originally did not exist on Rynum. After the creation of the Portals, the fate of the two planets became nearly inseparable; disasters caused on one would affect the other.

      <img src="images/heidi.jpg" alt="Heidi" class="heidi">
      <p class="charfact">
        Name: Heidi <br>
        Age: 17 <br>
        Birthday: April 3 <br>
        Hair: Blonde, short, always worn down <br>
        Eyes: Brown <br>
        Height: 5' 8 1/2"
      </p>
      <p>
        Heidi grew up with her older twin brother Henry under the care of their grandfather, a kind-hearted man named
        Charles. She never knew her parents, though a picture of her mother sat on her grandfather's desk in his study.
        Though she loved her grandfather dearly, she was the closest to her brother. She always knew that if there was
        no one there for her, Henry would be.
      </p>
      <p>
        As she grew up, Heidi found her passion in everything fantasy. She explored other worlds through reading,
        movies, and even video games. When she was not learning more about the fantasy worlds, she would draw, even so
        far as to doodle in class. When she and her brother discovered Rynum, it was as if every single one of her
        dreams had come true.
      </p>
      <p>
        During her adventures on Rynum, there was a point when she was known as Star Fire. As Star Fire, Heidi was the
        symbol of a revolution she didn't want to start. She had forgotten everything in her past and merely wanted to
        know who she really was. Heidi's deeply rooted moral compass lead to Star Fire defending the weak and bolstering
        the spirits of those who had lost the will to fight. Even after she found her true self, the name "Star Fire"
        continued on centuries later as a symbol of freedom and peace throughout Rynum.

      <h3>The Dragon Tear Pool</h3>
      <img src="images/tear-pool.jpg" alt="Dragon Tear Pool Sketch" class="tearpool">
      <p>
        Located high in the eastern mountains of Vorand, there is a pool of dragon tears. While not the only dragon tear
        pool, this specific pool has been the center of a lot of action throughout Rynumic history. When it was still a
        fairly new pool, it was the site of a brutal battle where the tears managed to capture many souls. Years later,
        after the pool had grown much deeper, there had been another small battle. Though there were not as many deaths
        in this battle, there was a particular death that, while did not impact history dramatically in a single moment,
        changed the course of history in the long term. The man who died was named Lizel, a mage who had power to copy
        himself. His was the first body to be left in any pool of dragon tears, due to the depth of this particular pool
        and this incident led to the creation of the first shapeshifter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only was this pool the location of the creation of the first shapeshifter but it was also the location of
        many other shapeshifter creations. Most were caused by accident, but there were also moments when this pool saw
        the forced creation of shapeshifters. Originally, dragon tear pools were created to honor people who had passed
        on, but this one became a place of death, bitterness, and forced wills.
